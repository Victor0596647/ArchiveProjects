It was the last day of school, and I felt sad because I won’t be able to see Minako and my best friends. Once we graduated from 10th grade at the end, Everyone started saying goodbye to their friends and teachers know and I also said goodbye to my friends and of course my girlfriend but once I said it, Minako hugged me and I hugged her back. My dad congratulated me for passing 10th grade He said that tomorrow he will be giving me a surprise. I wonder what’s it gonna be, Probably another math 100 pages book.

While I woke up to play videogames my dad surprised me with 7 tickets to Portland, Maine and I was shocked to see them. And I asked him why he bought 7 tickets, Then he told me “The rest of these are for your friends to go with” Then I said “what about you or someone to supervise us” “pfft you can take care of yourself p.s you don’t like it when I take care of you,” he said. Well he has a point there, anyway I contacted all of my friends including girlfriend and told them that we will be going to Portland, Maine then told that we should pack all our things for tomorrow because the flight will be going on 5 AM in the morning which will be morning once we reached there. I had a plan for going to the plane tomorrow so I thought at 4:20 am we go to the airport and wait a little until the lady speaks on the speaker for a gate then we go there on the airplane and relax until we get to Portland, Maine. Everybody was okay with the idea and there gonna be there. I started to pack my things for Tomorrow's flight after that I went to play video games until I had to pack it when I had to go to bed. And I also set my alarm so I can wake up at 4 am.
