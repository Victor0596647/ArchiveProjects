Okay, it is 3:51 am I'm a bit too early but it is good cause I have more time to dress up and get my stuff like video games and sketchbook and other things I need for the trip. Then, I said goodbye to my dad, mom, and my sister. I called an uber driver so I can get to the airport. I reached the airport and I am in the entrance looking for my friends and saw them like right next to the security check-up, I joined them. Then we wait until it was time to board the plane, well some of us played games, read, or listen to music while waiting. Just woke up it is 4:18 am our plane is about to go, so we went to the gate, luckily we were first inline, then got our seat section number went in the plane sat at our section number then waited until the plane finished loading in the packages.

The plane finished loading in the packages then the pilot on the speaker said “ladies and gentlemen, Welcome to United Airlines. We would like you to wear your seatbelts and watch the Airline’s safety video, Thank you.” Then the safety video came up on my screen, well….

I got bored so I played on my Nintendo switch for a while then went to sleep.

We went inside the airport and we went through the security check-up. And smelt the air of Portland, Maine. We didn’t know what to do next. But then Misami thought renting an apartment near the ocean. Everyone agreed to it. All of us searched for a place where we can stay on the map. Well couldn’t find an apartment which was near
